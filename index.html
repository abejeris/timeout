        <p>Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It's a day full of
          potential
          and
          hope, before all the dreary depressions of reality show up to ruin all the fun. I like the first day of school
          for a
          different reason, though. You see, I have a sort of power. When I look at people, I can...sense a sort of aura
          around
          them. A colored outline based on how long that person has to live. Most everyone I meet around my age is
          surrounded by a
          solid green hue, which means they have plenty of time left. A fair amount of them have a yellow-orangish tinge
          to
          their
          auras, which tends to mean a car crash or some other tragedy. Anything that takes people "before their time"
          as
          they
          say. The real fun is when the auras venture into the red end of the spectrum, though. Every now and again I'll
          see
          someone who's basically a walking stoplight. Those are the ones who get murdered or kill themselves. It's such
          a
          rush to
          see them and know their time is numbered. With that in mind, I always get to class very early so I can scout
          out
          my
          classmates' fates. The first kid who walked in was basically radiating red. I chuckled to myself. Too damn
          bad,
          bro. But
          as people kept walking in, they all had the same intense glow. I finally caught a glimpse of my rose-tinted
          reflection
          in the window, but I was too stunned to move. Our professor stepped in and locked the door, his aura a
          sickening
          shade
          of green.</p>

          The doctor pulled the stethoscope ear tips out and hung the device around his neck. "Mr. Weatherby, all of
          your
          tests
          have come back negative and my examination shows nothing abnormal." Adam knew what was coming next. "I'm not
          crazy,
          Doctor." "I'm sorry, but there is no physical reason for why you occasionally lose control of your hands. A
          psychologist
          can help..." "I don't need therapy. I need answers. They seem to have a life all their own. I can't hold a
          job.
          I'm under
          investigation for assault. I almost killed my neighbor. This can't go on. I'll try anything at this
          point." After
          two
          weeks on a new medication, Adam saw no progress and grew increasingly depressed. He was convinced that despite
          what the
          doctors said, it was not a psychological problem. That night, a frustrated and angry Adam sat in a chair and
          drank
          bourbon. Drunk and hopeless, he stumbled to the garage and started the table saw, then slowly lowered his
          wrists
          toward
          the screaming blade. Detective Armstrong entered the garage where several uniformed officers stood over the
          blood-soaked
          body. "So what do we got?" he asked, taking in the blood-splattered scene. "This is a weird one, Detective."
          "How
          so?" "Take
          a look at the body. He apparently chopped off his hands with the table saw and bled to death." Armstrong knelt
          down.
          "And?" "And we can't find his hands anywhere."

          I watched as my soon to be father-in-law held his daughter's hand as he walked down the aisle. Tears streamed
          down his
          face as the wedding march that played in the background reminded him that, in a few minutes, he would be
          watching me
          hold his daughter's hand and slipping on her ring. He walked up to the altar and I took hold of her hand,
          grinning from
          ear to ear. It was the happiest day of my life. My bride's father got down on his knees and started begging.
          "Please, I
          did what you asked. Just please give my daughter back." I glared at him. "Shut up and stop ruining the moment.
          If
          you sit
          back down and enjoy the ceremony, maybe I'll tell you where I've hidden the rest of her body."
